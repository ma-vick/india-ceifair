        The Taj Mahal is a magnificent white marble mausoleum located in Agra,
        India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his
        beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away during childbirth in 1631.
        Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653.

        The Taj Mahal&apos;s design is a fusion of various architectural styles,
        including Persian, Islamic, and Indian influences. The central dome is
        surrounded by four smaller domes and sits atop a large platform. The
        entire structure is adorned with intricate inlay work, calligraphy, and
        delicate marble carvings.

        The gardens around the Taj Mahal are meticulously laid out in a
        geometric pattern, with reflecting pools that enhance the beauty of the
        monument. The symmetry and elegance of the Taj Mahal have earned it the
        title of one of the most iconic and recognizable buildings in the world.
        It is also recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is considered
        a symbol of love and architectural brilliance.
